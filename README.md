Minesweepers-SaSeRos
====================

A project for Safe and Secure Robotics based on open-source software. The code can be loaded onto lego mindstorms. The core of the functionality is driving around and cleaning within a certain area. Also the main goal was building a safe and secure system. For example the robot shouldn't go rogue in case of unplugging a censor.
